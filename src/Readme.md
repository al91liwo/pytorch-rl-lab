# Source

The source directory contains all relevant algorithms and their specific configurations.
Our train_trial script has the role of a handler function right now, this will be corrected in the future.


## algorithm
Every folder in this directory should represent an Reinforcement-Learning [algorithm](algorithm/Readme.md).

## config
Every folder in [this directory](config/Readme.md) should represent an Reinforcement-Learning algorithm.

## utility
Feel free to add functions and scripts that eliminate redundant operations in your work!

### add your algorithm
